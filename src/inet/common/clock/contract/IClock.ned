package inet.common.clock.contract;

//
// This module interface is implemented by clock models. For example, having a
// clock in the model of a network device and using it for all timing (instead
// of the standard OMNeT++ simulation time) allows for modeling clock skew and
// clock drift. Clocks are typically simple modules, and are used by other modules
// via direct C++ method calls.
